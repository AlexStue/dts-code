Good first attempt, but this approach won't be applicable if the test dataset gets larger. 
You shouldn’t create a script and a Dockerfile for each dataset. 
Instead, you should place the dataset in a dictionary. 
You should only have one script per type of test (one script for Authentication, one for Authorization, and one for testing content), which implies a maximum of three Dockerfiles. 
You can also improve the structure of your submission a bit. The cleanest way is to create a folder for each test, placing the Dockerfile and the script inside, for example. 
It might also be helpful, as you refine this work, to review the "Unit Testing" module because we’re trying to simulate a unit test architecture through this exercise—an essential concept for a DevOps professional.

one script authentication
one script authorization
one script model
-> 3 dockerfiles


dataset as dictionary
one script per test
one dockerfile per test
